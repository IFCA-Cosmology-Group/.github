Welcome to the GitHub organization of the **[Observational Cosmology and Instrumentation group](https://computing.ifca.es)** of the [Instituto de FÃ­sica de Cantabria](https://ifca.unican.es) at the [Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)](https://www.csic.es) and the [University of Cantabria (UC)](https://web.unican.es).

The Observational Cosmology and Instrumentation group  at IFCA focuses on the study of several topics related to the origin and evolution of the Universe. Our research accounts for the analysis and interpretation of astronomical data, as well as for the design and development of instrumental devices to perform the measurement of these data.

## Research topics
- Gaussianity and isotropy of the cosmic microwave background
- Component separation of the microwave sky
- Large scale structure and secondary anisotropies
- Gravitational lensing
- Signal processing and statistics

## Instrumentation topics
- Microwave radiometers
- Near-Infra_red electro-optical technology for microwave instrumentation
- Calibration of CMB experiments
